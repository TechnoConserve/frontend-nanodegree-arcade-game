Frontend Nanodegree Frogger Clone
===============================

A basic clone of the classic arcade game Frogger. This game can now be played on my [personal
website](https://averyuslaner.com/projects/bugger/).

# How to Play

Use the arrow keys to move your character around the play field. Make it to the water without 
touching any of the enemy bugs to increase your score. The game ends when you get hit by a bug!

## Prerequisites

None.
